<b>To Use:</b> This is a unity porject file containing everything you need to upload to unity. To start, just open any of the .unity files in Assets/scenes. To see any of my code, just go to Assets/scripts and open any of the .cs files.<br>
<br>

<b>The Game:</b> This game is actually mostly my dad's original idea. He does a lot of driving around Oklahoma and sometimes complains about the police traps he often sees on his travels. I decided to make a game out of their "game." The game is definitely an exaggeration of what goes on during a traffic stop to allow for some fun game mechanics.<br>
You play as on officer posted for a speed trap and your goal is to get as much money as possible from drivers. You start on the side of a highway, looking for driver to pullover for any reason. When you find a reason, you then click he car and it starts a new scene with a persuasion/dialogue system that you are trying to beat, or atleast get as far as you can. Every driver has trais and reacts a little differently to your dialogue selections. If you reach high enough level in the dialogue system, you can search their car, attempt to plant drugs in their car and arrest them. This would maximize the money you could get from pulling someone over. The money is then used for upgrades to enhance your ability to get more money or unlock different areas to setup speed traps.<br>
<br>

<b>Current State:</b> Drivers have random traits and are randomly generated as they drive along the highway. Basic concept of the persuasion/dialogue system is in place.<br>
Any car labeled with a B are considered breaking the law and can be pulled over(clicked on).<br>
Reward system with money is in place and can be seen on top right, but with no upgrades available, it's useless.<br>
All graphics are placeholders pulled from the internet.<br>
No audio.<br>
Last time I opened this project and made progress was in 2017.
